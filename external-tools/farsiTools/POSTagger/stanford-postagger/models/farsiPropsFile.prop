## Sample properties file for maxent tagger. This file is used for three main
## operations: training, testing, and tagging. It may also be used to convert
## an old multifile tagger to a single file tagger or to dump the contents of
## a model.
## To train or test a model, or to tag something, run:
##   java edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent.MaxentTagger -prop <properties file>
## Arguments can be overridden on the commandline, e.g.:
##   java ....MaxentTagger -prop <properties file> -testFile /other/file 

# Model file name (created at train time; used at tag and test time)
# (you can leave this blank and specify it on the commandline with -model)

#model = $METAPHOR_DIR/models/farsiModels/farsiPOSModel/StanfordTagger/farsi.tagger.model.treebank

# Path to file to be operated on (trained from, tested against, or tagged)
# Specify -textFile <filename> to tag text in the given file, -trainFile <filename> to
# to train a model using data in the given file, or -testFile <filename> to test your
# model using data in the given file.  Alternatively, you may specify
# -dump <filename> to dump the parameters stored in a model or 
# -convertToSingleFile <filename> to save an old, multi-file model (specified as -model)
# to the new single file format.  The new model will be saved in the file filename.
# If you choose to convert an old file, you must specify 
# the correct 'arch' parameter used to create the original model.
#trainFile = $METAPHOR_DIR/external-tools/farsiTools/trainData/treebankForTagger

# Path to outputFile to write tagged output to.
# If empty, stdout is used.
# outputFile = 

# Output format. One of: slashTags (default), xml, or tsv
# outputFormat = slashTags

# Output format options. Comma separated list, but
# currently "lemmatize" is the only supported option.
# outputFormatOptions = 

# Tag separator character that separates word and pos tags
# (for both training and test data) and used for
# separating words and tags in slashTags format output.
tagSeparator = _

# Encoding format in which files are stored.  If left blank, UTF-8 is assumed.
encoding = UTF-8

# A couple flags for controlling the amount of output:
# - print extra debugging information:
verbose = false
# - print intermediate results:

######### parameters for tag and test operations #########

# Class to use for tokenization. Default blank value means Penn Treebank
# tokenization.  If you'd like to just assume that tokenization has been done,
# and the input is whitespace-tokenized, use
# edu.stanford.nlp.process.WhitespaceTokenizer or set tokenize to false.
# tokenizerFactory = 

# Options to the tokenizer.  A comma separated list.
# This depends on what the tokenizer supports.
# For PTBTokenizer, you might try options like americanize=false

# If false, your text must already be whitespace tokenized.

# the same information via openClassTags or closedClassTags below
# (only ONE of these three options may be specified). 
# 'english' means UPenn English treebank tags. 'german' is STTS
